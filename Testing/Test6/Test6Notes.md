## Circularity Test 6 Notes:

### Test 6 is different in methodology from the previous 5

This test is operated by performing multiple revolutions in a 5 second timeframe. In this test, we observe irregularity in circularity, radius, and center voltage through the right side display of the XY channel view. The maximum and minimum voltages of both axes both tend to fluctuate, seemingly gradually/periodically. It is uncertain, but this may be due to the spin of the lever shaft affecting the relative center voltage. This will be explored deeper in the testing section dedicated to deadzone, shaft spin, and button press.

The Y axis range over 9 cycles is from 1.44V to 3.49V

The X axis range over 9 cycles is from 1.39V to 3.43V

The RMS % Error is 9.29%, peaking at 16.03% error
