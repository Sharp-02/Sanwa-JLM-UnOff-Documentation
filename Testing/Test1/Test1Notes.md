# Test 1- Circularity and Range

Circularity seems to be fairly accurate

  Circularity is measured by 90 degree phase shift signal of X and Y channels

Y axis range is from 1.52V to 3.44V

X axis range is from 1.51V to 3.46V

The system is highly sensitive- changes are obscured to be unmeasureable with my current testing apparatus. System output resolution cannot be measurable with my current testing apparatus either. The average voltage change step is 0.0003377186083V on the Y axis and 0.0003372548544V on the X axis. It is unclear whether this size voltage step and difference in step voltage is attributable to the Sanwa JLM's internal electronic circuit or if it is due to the measurement resolution and relative precision of my measurement tools. Regardless, this change in voltage is attributable to 0.0175% of the full range of motion, or less than 1/100th of a degree of rotation.
