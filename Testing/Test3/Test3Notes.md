## Circularity Test 3 Notes:

Data is fairly uncircular. There is also a suggested nonlinearity as seen in the falling edge of Channel 2 (blue). There is a sharp transition in the line slope. This can be attributed to either user error or to non-linearity in the signal processing.

Y axis range is from 1.49V to 3.42V

X axis range is from 1.42V to 3.32V

RMS Error is 3.44%
