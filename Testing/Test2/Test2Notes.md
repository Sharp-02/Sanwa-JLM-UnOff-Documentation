## Circularity Test 2:

JLM Circularity Test 2 visually exhibits less circularity than test 1.

Circularity can be tested by calculating an average radius and best assumed centerpoint from the dataset. Then, test the vector length from the calculated centerpoint to every point on the circle. The percent difference betweeen the average radius and measured radius can be used to measure the average circularity and the maximum deviation.

Y Range: 1.54V to 3.44V

X Range: 1.52V to 3.45V
